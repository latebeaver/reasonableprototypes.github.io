<p>
  With a background in sociology and media studies, I am fascinated by how (digital) technology forms social practices and norms which in turn inform technological designs.
Currently, I am studying social and spatial practices emerging through the rise of digital platforms that facilitate movements of people, things, and data.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my career, I took consultant and manager roles in strategy, analytics, and product development working with people with a variety of professional and cultural background including data scientists, designers, aid workers and sales managers

</p>
<p>
  So far I've spent 60% my life in Korea, 21% in the UK, 16% in China and 3% in Kenya.

<p>
  Outside work, I love looking after my plants, seeing plays and playing tennis.
